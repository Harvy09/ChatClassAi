# ChatClass AI  
**An AI-powered oral quiz and learning assistant for classrooms and self-study.**

ChatClass AI transforms any document or topic into an **interactive, spoken learning experience**.  
It doesn’t just ask questions — it can **summarize uploaded PDFs**, **generate contextual quiz questions**, and **speak answers aloud**.  

Built with **Cerebras’ hosted Meta Llama 3.1-8B model**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for factual grounding, and **gTTS** for lifelike voice synthesis — all orchestrated through **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, and **Docker**.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Learning
- **PDF Summarization & Auto-Quiz Generation** — Upload any PDF (lesson, article, or study material) and let the AI summarize it and create relevant oral quiz questions.  
- **AI-generated Oral Q&A** — Uses **Meta’s Llama 3.1-8B** hosted on **Cerebras** for natural, context-aware question answering.  
- **Voice Output with gTTS** — Converts every question and answer into clear, human-like speech.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — Ensures accuracy by grounding responses in retrieved factual context.  

### ⚙️ Architecture & System Design
- **FastAPI Backend** — Manages RAG retrieval, LLM inference, and text-to-speech generation.  
- **Streamlit Frontend** — Provides a clean, interactive interface for classroom or self-learning use.  
- **Dockerized Setup** — Fully containerized backend and frontend for easy deployment and reproducibility.  
- **Cerebras × Meta Integration** — Combines Meta’s open-weight model with Cerebras’ high-performance inference infrastructure.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User (Browser)] -->|Interact| B[Streamlit Frontend]
    B -->|HTTP Request| C[FastAPI Backend]
    C -->|RAG Context + Query| D[(Cerebras Llama 3.1-8B API)]
    C -->|Generate Audio| E[gTTS (Text-to-Speech)]
```

**Flow:**
1. The user opens the Streamlit app and selects or uploads study material.  
2. The question or extracted text is sent to the FastAPI backend.  
3. The backend retrieves relevant context using **RAG (rag_utils.py)**.  
4. Context and query are sent to **Cerebras’ Llama 3.1-8B** model.  
5. The AI’s response is spoken aloud via **gTTS**, completing the oral learning loop.

## 📘 PDF Summarization & Auto-Quiz Generation

ChatClass AI can **ingest any uploaded PDF**, **summarize it**, and then **generate oral quiz questions** from its content — turning textbooks, notes, or research papers into interactive learning sessions.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U[User Uploads PDF] --> P[FastAPI Backend]
    P --> E[Text Extraction & Chunking]
    E --> S[Summary Generation via Cerebras Llama 3.1-8B]
    S --> Q[Question Generation Module]
    Q -->|Questions + Answers| F[Streamlit Frontend → Spoken via gTTS]
```

**How it works:**
1. The user uploads a `.pdf` file through the Streamlit interface.  
2. The backend extracts and cleans text from the PDF.  
3. The model summarizes the key concepts using **Cerebras Llama 3.1-8B**.  
4. Relevant quiz questions are generated from the summary.  
5. Questions and answers are spoken via **gTTS**, providing a fully voice-driven experience.

**Benefits:**
- Instantly converts study material into dynamic Q&A sessions.  
- Reduces manual quiz creation effort for teachers and learners.  
- Improves comprehension and retention with active recall and auditory reinforcement.

## 🧠 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration

```mermaid

    Q[User Question] --> R[Retriever: rag_utils.py]
    R -->|Relevant Context| M[Cerebras Llama 3.1-8B via Cerebras API]
    M -->|Grounded Answer| B[Backend → Streamlit → User]
```

**Purpose:**  
- Reduces hallucinations and ensures factual reliability.  
- Makes ChatClass AI adaptable to multiple knowledge bases.
